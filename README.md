# Airline Passengers Forecasting Using Time Series Methods

In this section, we will estimate airline passengers using time series methods.

<hr />

ðŸ“Œ We used the following methods for airline passenger forecasting:

**SES**: Single Exponential Smoothing

**DES**: Double Exponential Smoothing

**TES**: Triple Exponential Smoothing

**ARIMA**: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average

**SARIMA**: Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average

# Business Problem

ðŸ“Œ In this section, we estimate the number of passengers in the coming years by examining the number of passengers in the past years.

# Dataset Story

ðŸ“Œ This dataset contains how many passengers traveled monthly from 1949 to 1960.

**Month**: the date in the month is a variable.

**Passengers**: estimates the number of passengers per month.
